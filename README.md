# cs50_final
This project is intended is be used on CS50 codespaces, but it could theoretically be used on any codespaces since we do not use CS50 specific functions. In this project, we attempted to create an all-encompassing soccer website. It displays the standings of the 5 European primary leagues in soccer and the World Cup. Moreover, it allows you to bet on World Cup games and not regular soccer matches as the leagues are stopped due to the World Cup and thus the betting data for those matches are not available. It welcomes you and displays images of the leagues and of the world cup which are clickable and brings you to those pages within the website.

Firstly, the website starts at the home page. This consists of a bootstrap navigation bar which has Home, Leagues, World Cup 2022, Register, Login, Account, and Log Out.

Home redirects you to the home page with no login required.

Leagues contains the Big Five European Soccer Leagues and displays their standings. There is the table of the league which shows the position of each team. Then, there are the actual matches that have been played last round and are coming up next round.

World Cup 2022 contains the standings of the World Cup where positions of each country are shown within their respective group.

Register allows the user to register into the system by inputting their username and password twice.

Login allows the user to log into their account that they created in register.

Account lets the user view information related to the bets they have placed: status, match, your bet team, amount, odds, time, and your balance.

Log out lets the user log out of their account.
